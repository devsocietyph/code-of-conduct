# Code of Conduct
The official Developers' Society Code of Conduct, implemented across all chapters and subdivisons.

Developers' Society is a student-run community that exists to provide opportunities for makers, as well as a space for inclusivity and collaboration. In the provision of an empowering and diverse experience, we stipulate these rules to ensure safety and security across our community. These rules are to be strictly followed; without the community, Developers' Society is nothing.

We do not merely promote tolerance, rather, aim to actively focus on improving diversity, representing ideals and opinions from people of all backgrounds and perspectives. If ever you feel that Developers' Society's conservation grows too one-sided or is lacking in the community aspect, we encourage you to reach out to us so we can strengthen these efforts (but hope it would not come to the situation where this would have to be called out on us). In promoting a technology community, it's important to represent opinions from all nodes and branches--we live on tech built for the world, by the world.

For clear policies and guidelines in case of any issues, please read the following document. It is of our utmost priority to ensure that every member feels included and has the ideal experience within the organization.

## Rules

* No harrasment or discrimination, including personal attacks. This includes hate speech or statements against certain groups, tasteless/offensive jokes such as rape jokes, or the **promotion of individuals that tolerate/promote such behavior.**

Essentially.


If you are experiencing an issue with a member or officer of the organization (applicable to all chapters and subdivisions, including Cipher and Developers' Society community/school chapters) please privately consult either *any of the group administrators* on Facebook via private message.

## Inclusivity Statement

We encourage individuals, whether students or not, from any background or topic of interest to be a part of our community; the only requirement being an interest or passion towards technology. We explicitly honor diversity of all kinds and forms, and do *not* tolerate any sorts of discrimination; whether from our members within the organization, behavior at Developers' Society events and of its sponsors or affiliated groups.



For any questions or suggestions to this document, please send us a message at *hello@devsociety.ph*.
